# New-York-MTA-EDA
Here is my first project during my data science bootcamp by Istanbul Data Science Academy.
Aim: WomenTechWomenYes, a fictional non-profit organization, is organizing a gala dinner in which they will raise donations and create awareness towards Women in business. They are asking us to find the ideal date and time to locate their staff at a metro station in order to collect mail addresses and send them free tickets to their gala. The gala dinner will take place at the beginning of June. By using MTA turnstile data, we will try to analyze the busiest time interval and station.

This project consists of 4 steps:
1-Specifying Time Interval and Data Cleaning→ Phyton (Pandas)
2-Analysis →Phyton (Pandas)
3-Visualization →Tableau
